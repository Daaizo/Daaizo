### :man_technologist: &nbsp;About Me :

I'm a Computer Science enthusiast who finds joy in coding, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and refine my skills.

- 🔭 My Work:
  - I work daily with Java technologies, such as Spring, Vert.x, Mockito, and JUnit for testing. I'm comfortable with Git for version control, and I have experience with databases like Oracle, Cassandra, and MongoDB. Additionally, on a daily basis, I'm working with REST and MVC architectures. I'm also capable of writing jQuery and creating basic Angular code. In my spare time, I continue to learn and explore new technologies.
- ⚡ Hobbies:
    - When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you might find me absorbed in the pages of thrilling books. My literary tastes span from gripping thrillers to fantastical adventures. Beyond books, I used to be a kick-boxer, but lately, my passion lies in powerlifting :weight_lifting_man:
- 🚀 Strengths and weaknesses:
  - I accept my perfectionist nature, considering it both my greatest strength and sometimes my greatest challenge. Although I may seem a bit reserved and shy at first, my commitment manifests itself in everything I do. I always try to give my best.
